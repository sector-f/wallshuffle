wallshuffle.sh

Give directory as first argument

Optionally give wait time in seconds as second argument (default is 60)

Currently only supports jpg and png, until I can find a complete list of filetypes supported by feh

TODO:
Add support for multiple directories?
Figure out which filetypes feh/Imlib2 actually supports
Format README I guess
