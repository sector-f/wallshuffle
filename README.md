### wallshuffle.sh

Give one or more directories or images as arguments

Use `-i <NUMBER>` or `--interval <NUMBER>` to specify the wait time between changing wallpapers, in seconds. The default is 60.

Currently only supports jpg and png, until I can find a complete list of filetypes supported by feh

####TODO
- Add support for image names with spaces
- Figure out which filetypes feh/Imlib2 actually supports
